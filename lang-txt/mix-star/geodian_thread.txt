$geodianthread_01_description=欢迎来到晶洞世界，寻宝者！我是琥珀玉髓。\n\n帮助寻日者罗万修好飞船，返回晶洞的人就是你吧？他说你还没做好面对超强暗影的准备。不过我们会帮助你做好准备的！\n\n首先，你需要在这儿收集资源，升级你的装备。也就是说你得去晶洞下方的洞窟里探险。那里很危险，我们已经禁止大部分晶洞人进去了，但寻日者们为你开辟了一道传送门。\n\n乘空气梯去挖矿设施，然后穿过紫色传送门就到月光石窟了。(It's time to explore the depths of Geode, Trovian! I'm Amberine.\n\nThe caves are too dangerous for most Geodians, but the Sunseekers have opened portals just for Trovians like you.\n\nYou can use either the portal down below in the Geodian Guild Hall or the Atlas to get to Geode. Once you land in Geode take an airavator down to the Mining Facility and use the purple portal to Moonglow Grotto.)
$geodianthread_02_name=使用你的攀爬爪(Use Your Climbing Claw)
$geodianthread_02_description=你的探索服总共有两项主要组件，晶洞适应系统（通称命气）和净电荷。命气能让你适应洞窟的恶劣环境，而净电荷则可以为探索服的其他模组供能。\n\n我最喜欢的模组就是攀爬爪啦！它能让你快速抵达高处，还能击退洞窟生物——当然，不会伤害到它们。\n\n使用攀爬爪，抓住墙壁或边缘。(The main parts of your discovery suit are the GAS, or Geodian Acclimation System, and N-Charge. The GAS allows you to withstand the caves' atmosphere longer, while the N-Charge powers the rest of your modules.\n\nMy favorite module is the Climbing Claw! It can grapple onto higher ledges or knock back critters - without injury, of course. We Geodians would never harm a thing!\n\nUse your Climbing Claw and latch onto a wall or ledge.)
$geodianthread_03_description=想要收集资源的时候，使用万用工具就行。\n\n你使用的是初版万用工具，所以有效范围比较短，不过你可以在模组熔炉里升级它。\n\n使用你的万用工具。(For all your gathering needs, you've got the Omni-Tool.\n\nIt's short-range for now, but you can upgrade that later at the Module Forge.\n\nUse your Omni-Tool.)
$geodianthread_04_description=我说你！既然你必须打搅这些洞窟生物的宁静生活，那就尽量帮它们的忙。\n\n我已经让琥珀玉髓给你生物糖果、治疗包和舒适毯子了。你就拿那些东西去帮助洞窟生物吧。这些道具现在应该已经装备到你的快捷栏里了。用完了可以去我们避难所的晶体加工中心，用你在洞窟中收集到的材料再做点。\n\n帮助3只洞窟生物。对饥饿的洞窟生物使用生物糖果，对受伤的洞窟生物使用治疗包，对冻着的洞窟生物使用舒适毯子。(YOU THERE! If you MUST invade the home of the creatures who live in these caves, I insist you help them.\n\nI had Amberine give you Critter Treats, Curing Kits, and Comfort Blankets to tend to the cave critters you find. They should already be equipped to your hotkey bar. If you run out, make more at our sanctuary's Crystallogy Center using materials from the caves.\n\nHelp 3 cave critters. Use Critter Treats on hungry critters, Curing Kits on injured critters, and Comfort Blankets on cold critters.)
$geodianthread_05_description=哎哟。寻日者盖布罗是不是朝你大吼大叫来着？我们这位伙伴大师最看不得的就是洞窟生物被暗影伤害了……他不是故意朝你发火的。\n\n你能帮我们收集一些材料吗？这样就能赢得盖布罗的信任了。\n\n用你的万用工具在月光洞窟中收集40份微光之石、月石、旭日遗落物或梦露吧。(Oof. Did Sunseeker Gabbro yell at you? Our Companion Master's frazzled after caring for all the creatures being hurt by Shadows... He doesn't mean anything by it.\n\nWhy don't you go gather some materials for us? That would get you in Gabbro's good graces for sure.\n\nUse your Omni-Tool to gather 40 gleamstone, moonstone, day drops, or dream dew in Moonglow Grotto.)
$geodianthread_06_name=用完命气(Run out of GAS)
$geodianthread_06_description=在洞窟中一定要尽快行动。\n\n一旦你的命气（工具栏上的红色槽）用完，我们训练有素的冒险者就会来找你的。\n\n继续探索这片区域，直到命气用完为止。你也可以随时按[HK:Homeworld]返回晶洞避难所。(Travel through the caves as far as you can!\n\nOnce your GAS (the red meter on your toolbar) runs out, one of our trained adventurers will come fetch you.\n\nExplore the area until you run out of GAS. You can also return to the Geode Sanctuary at any time by pressing [HK:Homeworld].)
$geodianthread_07_description=你就是来拯救我们的寻宝者？哼。\n\n我是寻日者拉祖尔。首先，你还是先救几只洞窟生物吧——也好让盖布罗省省心。能做到这点我才会认同你。\n\n来吧！晶体加工在等待着你。它能让你变得更强，它能让你变得更壮。\n\n前往西侧的晶体加工工作台处，制作1份生物糖果。(YOU are the Trovian come to save us? Hm.\n\nI am Sunseeker Lazul. First, you will save more cave creatures - and save Gabbro some heartache. Then, we will see about saving us.\n\nCome! Crystallogy awaits. Crystallogy fortifies. Crystallogy will make you bolder yet.\n\nCraft 1 Critter Treat at the Crystallogy Workbench located to the west.)
$geodianthread_08_name=兑换圣物箱券(Redeem Reliquary Token)
$geodianthread_08_description=干得漂亮！拉祖尔给了你一张圣物箱券。你可以在圣物箱研究所兑换它——不过你看到寻日者瑟兰时别害怕。她是站在我们这边的。 \n\n乘空气梯到楼上，然后找西侧的圣物箱商人桑德罗斯兑换圣物箱券。(Nice! Lazul gave you a Reliquary Token. Redeem it at the Reliquary Research Lab - and don't be alarmed by Sunseeker Th'lan, if you see her. She's on our side. \n\nTake an airavator up one floor and head west to redeem your token with Reliquary Merchant Thundros.)
$geodianthread_09_name=前往沉没日库（或其他晶洞洞窟）(Go to Sunken Sunvault (or another Geode cave))
$geodianthread_09_description=你很强……瑟兰看得出来。\n\n带上圣物箱！里面藏着远古者的遗物。他们的魔法就在圣物箱的深处。沉没日库在召唤着圣物箱……把它运到那里……让远古者重返家园……\n\n乘空气梯前往挖矿设施，返回晶洞洞窟。威瑟兰建议你这次用橙色传送门直接前往沉没日库。(You are strong... Th'lan sees.\n\nCarry the Reliquary! Remnants of Ancients lie inside. Down, deep, magic sleeps. Sunken Sunvault calls... Return the reliquary... return the Ancient to its home...\n\nTake an airavator down to the Mining Facility and return to the Geode caves. Th'lan suggests you use the orange portal to go to Sunken Sunvault this time.)
$geodianthread_10_name=为你的圣骨箱充能(Charge Your Reliquary)
$geodianthread_10_description=圣骨箱保管的是远古能量……瑟兰知道这一点。圣骨箱渴求魔力。洞窟中充斥着魔力……把魔力喂给圣骨箱。瑟兰就能打开它！\n\n在探索服配置界面装备兑换圣骨箱。治疗、喂食或抚慰洞窟中的生物都能为圣骨箱充能。(Ancient power locked inside... Th'lan knows. Reliquary hungry for magic. Magic flows through caves... Feed reliquary. Let Th'lan break it open!\n\nEquip the Token Reliquary in your discovery suit loadout. Heal, feed, or comfort critters in the caves to charge your reliquary.)
$geodianthread_11_description=圣物箱已经准备就绪了……瑟兰听得出来。它在哼鸣，它在歌唱。它已经准备献出远古者在几个纪元前准备的礼物了。我们必须打开它。\n\n把它带给我……瑟兰会打开它！\n\n耗尽命气或按[HK:Homeworld]返回避难所。乘空气梯到楼上，把你的圣物箱放在位于寻日者广场西侧的开启装置上。(The reliquary is ready... Th'lan hears. It hums. It sings. With gifts Ancients bring. Power from eons ago. It must be revealed.\n\nBring it to the revealer... Th'lan will crack it open!\n\nReturn to the sanctuary by running out of GAS or pressing [HK:Homeworld]. Take an airavator up one floor and place your reliquary into the revealer located on the west side of Sunseeker Square.)
$geodianthread_12_description=你已经获得触摸圣物箱的许可了！？看来寻日者瑟兰还挺欣赏你的。\n\n你能再去趟沉没日库，帮我们收集一些材料吗？去之前记得带上生物糖果！盖布罗会很开心的。\n\n从沉没日库处收集75份太阳精气、旭日遗落物、微光之石或燃晶。作为交换，我会给你一份加速晶，它能加速圣物箱的开启过程或伙伴蛋的孵化过程。(You're allowed to touch the reliquaries!? Sunseeker Th'lan must like you. Hehe.\n\nWould ya mind going back to Sunken Sunvault and gathering more materials? And don't forget to craft more critter treats before you go! It'd make Gabbro happy.\n\nGather 75 sun sap, day drops, gleamstone, or blazine from Sunken Sunvault. In exchange, I'll give you an Accelerite, which decreases the time it takes for reliquaries and companion eggs to open.)
$geodianthread_13_description=寻日者瑟兰急需鲜绿脉络的资源！\n\n你下次到避难所，直接使用底楼的绿色传送门就能前往鲜绿脉络了。\n\n还有，拉祖尔发现你，呃，不太擅长抵达高处，所以她给你做了些勘探平台。你可以用它们抵达洞窟内的高处，收集那里的资源。用光了之后再用晶体加工技术制作就行。(Sunseeker Th'lan needs resources from Verdant Veins!\n\nNext time you're in the sanctuary, use the green portal on the bottom floor to go to Verdant Veins.\n\nAlso, Lazul noticed that you uh, might need help reaching high places, so she made you Prospecting Platforms. Use them to reach higher-up materials in the caves! If you run out, make more with Crystallogy.)
$geodianthread_14_description=双生石……双子晶……还有深处的绿色植物……舞动的藻类……瑟兰都需要！\n\n为瑟兰收集这些东西……你就能获得……远古者的礼物……\n\n从鲜绿脉络处收集75份洞窟藻、双子晶、微光之石或旭日遗落物。(Twin stone... geminite... and greens from the deep... Wavy kelp... back and forth... Th'lan needs!\n\nGather these for Th'lan... and receive... the Ancients' gift...\n\nGather 75 cave kelp, geminite, gleamstone, or day drops from Verdant Veins.)
$geodianthread_15_description=升级时间到！\n\n想要提升你的净电荷容量，或是提升万用工具的效率吗？只要有对应的材料，你就能用模组熔炉尽情升级你的装备！\n\n你可以在位于避难所底楼传送门旁边的模组熔炉处，查看所有可用的升级。(UPGRADE TIME\n\nWant to increase your N-Charge capacity or power-up your Omni-Tool? With the right crafting materials, you can upgrade all of your equipment at the Module Forge!\n\nSee your available upgrades at the Module Forge, located near the portals on the bottom floor of the sanctuary.)
$geodianthread_16_description=如果你想探索洞窟的更深处，就必须升级命气！\n\n目前你探索的都是洞窟的1级区域。但只要经过升级，命气就能经受住洞窟2级区域更为恶劣的环境——至少能坚持上一会儿。\n\n在模组熔炉升级你的命气。(If you want to travel deeper into the caves, you've got to upgrade your GAS!\n\nSo far you've mostly explored Tier 1 of the caves. This next GAS upgrade will allow you to withstand the intense atmosphere of Tier 2 - for a while, at least.\n\nUpgrade your GAS capacity at the Module Forge.)
$geodianthread_17_description=你拿到探测器核心了！这下你就能在模组熔炉旁的模组工作台处制作出一台探测器了。\n\n探测器能探测到隐藏的水晶，还能显示矿脉的完整深度。\n\n制作出一台探测器并在洞窟中使用它。我为你准备了几个圣物箱奖励。说来也怪，她本来不同意把它们给我的，但在我告诉她它们是为你准备的奖励后她就改口了。嘿嘿。(You earned a Thumper Core! Now you can make a Thumper at the Module Workbench, next to the Module Forge.\n\nThe Thumper reveals hidden crystals and shows you the full depth of ore veins!\n\nCraft a Thumper and use it in the caves. As a reward, I picked up some reliquaries from Th'lan! Funny, she only let me have 'em once she found out they were for you. Hehe.)
$geodianthread_18_description=我们的伙伴大师——你还记得他吗？就是寻日者盖布罗。他最近一直在操心洞窟生物的安危。徘徊在洞窟外面的暗影把它们吓得不轻……\n\n他需要一些植物，用来调养他照顾的那些生物。你能帮他去收集这些植物吗？\n\n从月光洞窟处收集35份梦露、旭日遗落物、善变树皮和月光青苔。梦露和旭日遗落物生长在1级和2级洞窟内。善变树皮和月光青苔则只生长在2级洞窟内。(Our Companion Master - do you remember him? Sunseeker Gabbro? He's been really worried about the cave critters lately. The Shadows outside have them all scared...\n\nHe needs some plants to help the creatures under his care. Would you go get some for him?\n\nGather 35 pieces of dream dew, day drops, acrobat bark, and moonlit moss from Moonglow Grotto. Dream dew and day drops grow in Tier 1 and Tier 2. Acrobat bark and moonlit moss only grow in Tier 2.)
$geodianthread_19_description=化为光芒吧！抱歉我上次对你那么粗鲁。暗影伤害了很多晶洞生物……总之就是，诸事不顺啊。\n\n我是寻日者盖布罗，我写过有关晶洞生物的书——有好几本呢！这些生物实在是太有趣了。\n\n你能去洞窟里帮我用生物糖果、舒适毯子和治疗包安抚25只生物吗？我和它们都会非常感激你的。(Be the light! I apologize for my rudeness the last time we spoke. Shadows have hurt quite a lot of Geodian creatures... and it, well, it's been difficult.\n\nI am Sunseeker Gabbro. I wrote the book on Geodian creatures - several books, in fact! They're such fascinating creatures.\n\nCould you go and soothe 25 creatures in the caves with Critter Treats, Comfort Blankets, and Curing Kits? I, and they, would be grateful.)
$geodianthread_20_description=盖布罗让我转达他的谢意！\n\n总之，我想跟你说的是，我就快完成一项大发明了！你去鲜绿脉络帮我收集一些必需材料吧。\n\n从鲜绿脉络处挖掘75份双子晶。(Gabbro told me to pass along his thanks!\n\nAnyway, I wanted to tell you that I'm almost done with an invention that'll really knock your socks off! Go grab me some materials from Verdant Veins so I can finish it.\n\nMine 75 geminite from Verdant Veins.)
$geodianthread_21_description=有了我给你的这些推进器，你就能制作火箭靴啦！只要穿上它们，任何人都追不上你，包括寻日者罗万！当然，除非他也穿着火箭靴。嘿嘿。\n\n在挖矿设施的模组工作台处制作出火箭靴。(With those Thrusters I gave you, you can make Rocket Boots! You can outrun anything with these - even Sunseeker Rowan! Unless he's wearing them too. Hehe.\n\nCraft Rocket Boots at the Module Workbench in the Mining Facility.)
$geodianthread_22_description=你收集到的材料帮了我们很多忙。这下我们说不定真的能击败那些……你懂的。\n\n寻日者们说，他们在保卫这里的时候用光了我们的矿石。你能去帮我们弄点矿石吗？\n\n随便找个洞窟，挖个150份矿石就行了。(The materials you've collected have helped us out so much. Now we might actually stand a chance against... you know.\n\nThe Sunseekers say that they've nearly depleted our ore supplies defending this place already. Would you mind getting more for us?\n\nMine 150 ore from caves of your choice.)
$geodianthread_23_description=你好啊，年轻的寻宝者。我照顾的生物让我的助手们很头疼，因为它们把我们的有机食品全给吃光了！\n\n很不可思议吧？真是太有意思了！不过你能不能帮我们去收集更多植物？\n\n只要20份月下青苔、齿轮酒、善变树皮或洞窟鸟就行。这些植物只出现在洞窟的2级区域。(Hello again, young Trovian. The creatures under my care have bewildered my assistants by consuming every scrap of organic matter they could sink their little teeth into!\n\nUnusual behavior, isn't it? Utterly fascinating! In the meantime, would you go and gather more plants for us?\n\nGather 20 moonlit moss, cogwine, acrobat bark, or cavebirds. These plants can only be found in Tier 2 of the caves.)
$geodianthread_24_description=好消息！我就快完成我的最新发明：屏障生成器了。就差一点月光洞窟的材料就能完成了。\n\n你能去月光洞窟帮我收集75份燃晶吗？(Exciting news! I'm ready to put the finishing touch on my latest invention: the Barrier Generator. I just need a few more materials from Sunken Sunvault.\n\nWould you go to to Sunken Sunvault and mine 75 blazine for me?)
$geodianthread_25_description=你可以建造屏障生成器啦！它能保护你不受洞窟中的环境灾害影响，还能提升你的速度！\n\n寻日者们都说洞窟的最深处非常危险，所以这件宝贝你肯定用得上。\n\n在避难所底楼的模组工作台处制作出屏障生成器，然后在下一场冒险中使用它。(You can build the Barrier Generator now! The Barrier Generator shields you from environmental hazards in the caves and boosts your speed!\n\nSunseekers say that the deepest parts of the cave can be dangerous, so you'll definitely want to have this one in your back pocket.\n\nCraft the Barrier Generator at the Module Workbench on the bottom floor of the Sanctuary and use it on your next adventure!)
$geodianthread_26_description=琥珀玉髓说你很擅长收集东西。看来你还是有点用处的。继续干你擅长的事吧。\n\n水晶中心需要40份洞窟藻和齿轮酒。鲜绿脉络的最深处有很多。\n\n洞窟藻生长在1级和2级洞窟内，而齿轮酒则只生长在2级洞窟内。(Amberine says you collect things well. You are useful. Do more of this.\n\nWe require 40 Cave kelp and cogwine at the Crystallogy Center. The depths of Verdant Veins flows with it.\n\nCave kelp grows in Tier 1 and Tier 2. Cogwine only grows in Tier 2.)
$geodianthread_27_description=又热又烫……闪闪发亮，飞在空中……瑟兰需要它们。把它们带给瑟兰！黑暗深处……洞窟深处……充满能量。必须解锁！\n\n在沉没日库内收集40份太阳精气和洞窟鸟。太阳精气生长在1级和2级洞窟内，而洞窟鸟则只生长在2级洞窟内。(Blazing and chirping... blooming and flying... Th'lan needs. Bring them for Th'lan! Down dark... sunken deep... much power. Must be unlocked!\n\nGather 40 sun sap and cave birds in Sunken Sunvault. Sun Sap grows in Tier 1 and Tier 2. Cave Birds only grow in Tier 2.)
$geodianthread_28_description=嘿嘿。想找你帮忙的寻日者都排成队了。但你可别把我给忘了！我是第一个信任你的人。所以我有特权。\n\n请收集40份旭日遗落物和月下青苔。每个洞窟里都有这两种材料。作为回报，我可以告诉你一样好东西的制作方式。(Hehe. The other Sunseekers are all lining up to get your help next, now. But don't forget about me! I was your first fan. I get dibs.\n\nPlease gather 40 day drops and moonlit moss! They grow in all of the caves. In exchange, I'll tell ya how to make something awesome.)
$geodianthread_29_description=你现在可以制作路线标记器啦！路线标记器能让你标记洞窟中的方块，确认你当前的位置。踩在被标记的方块上还能提升你和你周围寻宝者的速度。\n\n在模组工作台上制作一个路线标记器并在洞窟试试它的效果吧！(You can now craft the Path Painter! The Path Painter allows you to you to paint blocks in the caves and can keep track of where you've been. Stepping on the painted blocks will also give you and Trovians around you a speed boost.\n\nCraft a Path Painter at the Module Workbench and try it out when you are in the caves.)
$geodianthread_30_description=我能提供的新款模组就这些啦！你探索起洞窟来真是越来越娴熟了。你的探索距离已经快跟我一样了！我觉得你很快就能赶上寻日者了！\n\n使用避难所底楼的模组熔炉升级你的命气。(That was the last new module I had for you! You are becoming a cave-diving pro. You've already traveled as far in as I've ever been! I think you might even be able to travel as far as the Sunseekers soon!\n\nUse the Module Forge on the bottom floor of the sanctuary to upgrade your GAS.)
$geodianthread_31_description=啊哈！我正在找你呢！ \n\n我一直照顾着的吼罗格最近总是病恹恹的。我想喂她最喜欢吃的植物——洞窟鸟，让她打起精神。二十份鲜美多汁洞窟鸟应该就能让她重新振作起来了。\n\n从沉没日库处收集20份洞窟鸟，洞窟鸟只生长在2级及以上区域。(AHA! Just the Trovian I was looking for. \n\nA once-buoyant little Howlug under my care has been ill lately. To cheer her up, I'd like to surround her with her favorite plants - cave birds! Twenty beautiful, bountiful cave birds will brighten her spirits in no time.\n\nGather 20 cave birds from Sunken Sunvault. Cave birds only grow in Tier 2 and beyond.)
$geodianthread_32_description=光有洞窟鸟还不够！我可爱的吼罗格最近一跳都不肯跳。它以前可喜欢蹦蹦跳跳了！看到她现在这样真是让我心如刀割。如果你想了解我的心有多痛，我可以把这件事写在我的下一本书里。\n\n总之，我觉得它只要吃下善变树皮应该就能恢复精神了。\n\n从月光石窟处收集20份善变树皮。善变树皮只生长在2级及以上区域。(The Cave Birds weren't enough! This sweet Howlug has lost nearly all her bounce. She was so bouncy before! It saddens me to see her this way. I've written it all down in my latest book if you care to read more.\n\nIn any case, I believe what'll really put some bounce in her step is some acrobat bark.\n\nGather 20 acrobat bark from the ceilings of Moonglow Grotto. Acrobat bark only grows in Tier 2 and beyond.)
$geodianthread_33_description=吓死我了！原来这只吼罗格根本没生病——它只是怀孕了！是这样的，它们很擅长掩盖自己怀孕的事实，连我都很难发现！而我已经写了三十本以它们为主题的书了。\n\n吼罗格很感激你的帮助，她坚持要送你一颗蛋。\n\n到东边的伙伴农场看看孵蛋器吧，我会教你怎么用它的。(What a day! It turns out this Howlug wasn't ill at all – only pregnant! They're quite skilled at hiding it, you see, even from me! And I've written thirty books on it!\n\nThe Howlug was so grateful for your assistance, she insisted that you have one of her eggs.\n\nCome have a look at the Egg Incubator at the Companion Ranch to the east and I'll show you how to use it.)
$geodianthread_34_description=把你的蛋放在孵蛋器内，等待它孵化！\n\n我感觉这只吼罗格很快就能孵出来。它肯定等不及见它的主人了！(Place place your egg inside the Egg Incubator and watch it hatch!\n\nI have a feeling this one will hatch quickly. It must be excited to meet its proud new caretaker!)
$geodianthread_35_description=哇！你已经有属于自己的伙伴了？盖布罗可是说洞窟生物是很难信任其他种族的。我都有点嫉妒你了。\n\n盖布罗还说过，这些洞窟生物能在你探索洞窟时协助你。如果你有牵绊结晶器，还能用它们升级你的伙伴呢！\n\n你应该带你的吼罗格一起去洞窟冒险，看看它能做些什么。(Wow! You really have your own companion? Gabbro says it takes a LOT for cave creatures to trust you. I'm almost jealous.\n\nGabbro told me that these creatures help you out as you explore. You can even level them up at the Companion Trainer if you have Bond Crystallizer!\n\nYou should bring this Howlug with you into the caves and see what it can do.)
$geodianthread_36_description=你的吼罗格好像很满意你这个主人！嘿嘿，我也不是不能理解它的心情啦。\n\n尽情探索吧。\n\n等你获得足够的资源，升级完你的命气，就能前往3级洞窟，正式超越我了。你真的很厉害！\n\n还有一件事……我想谢谢你愿意来到晶洞世界。当罗万说，你说不定就是我们的救世主时我还将信将疑呢。但真正认识你后我才发现，他说得没错。\n\n收集资源，升级命气，前往3级及以上洞窟探险。(Your howlug looks happy to be with you! Hehe. I can understand why.\n\nFeel free to explore as you like.\n\nOnce you get enough resources for your next GAS upgrade, you'll be able to go into Tier 3! That's further than I've ever gone. I'm impressed!\n\nOne more thing, while I've still got you: Thank you for coming to Geode. I was skeptical when Rowan told us that you might be able to save us. But after meeting you... I've never been so happy to be wrong.\n\nGather materials to upgrade your GAS to explore Tier 3 and beyond.)
