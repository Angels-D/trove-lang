$Claims_saminator_12=…but just as soon, disappeared!

$Claims_Event_meteor_01=The Ancient Dracolich was also hoarding this.
$Claims_Event_meteor_02=The last Robowraith had this. Wait, why do meteors have batteries?
$Claims_Event_meteor_03=This was baked into a Poundcake.  Crunchy surprise, indeed.
$Claims_Event_meteor_04=Those meteor chunks glow with inner radiance. Or radiation. And so do these.
$Claims_Event_meteor_05=It's alive!  Oh, wait no.  It is displaying a hologram though.
$Claims_Event_meteor_06=The Data Projector abruptly drops these out like gumballs.
$Claims_Event_meteor_07=Your Data Projector goes quiet, grunts, and somewhat painfully extrudes this.
$Claims_Event_meteor_08=The amassed loot from those dungeons should be enough.
$Claims_Event_meteor_09=How this small device holds so much gem stuff is baffling.
$Claims_Event_meteor_10=As it is being mounted in, the Data Projector hits the jackpot and spills all this out.
