Now, go to the future.\n\nPut the Futurator on your action bar, throw it, and go through to the future. Find the Citadel, and get to the top. It is somewhere nearby.

We were the scourge of the seas, and we were everywhere at once... because there were two of us! But hard to find of course, because we were elusive pirates.\n\nI stopped working out and lost a lot of muscle mass while he... got meaner. I set up shop in the Hub. But he... he went into hiding. He created the Saminators, and caused the future that we all will suffer with. I need to think about what I would do if I were him. Which I am, basically.\n\nGet a few fish for me, would you? It helps me focus.

You may have noticed that the Saminator sailors have collected diary pages from ...a stowaway perhaps? This person seems to know how to catch plasma fish. Find the final page! A deserter was spotted escaping to the desert with some papers. Find him and bring back the final page of these stowaway notes!

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_meteor_11_Name=Collect the Scout Saucer
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_meteor_11_Description=Meteor Chase 11/11: You did it! You reconstructed a flying saucer from... an alien visitor who crashed to our world.

$Quest_GoldenThread_event_september2021_09_Description=Fae Vs Undead 2021 9/9: Well Trovian, I guess its not really fair for us to make you pick sides. How about this? The Undead have a crafting Cauldron and the Prince has a crafting Hookah. Why don't you go make a terraformer and terraform your very own Tombs? Whichever one you craft will be the winner, for you at least! Just saying, Undead for life (or death, you get it?!). Just go make one. Oh, and you'll need those Honor Tokens to craft them. See ya around boyo.

$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_02_Description=Shadow's Eve 2/11: Greetings Trovian. I am Lunavic, High Priest of the Order of the Moon. It is wondrous to meet you, even on such a shadowed occasion. Our order stands against the Shadow on all occasions, but especially when its strength is at its peak, during Shadow’s Eve.\n\nThis year a terrible curse has fallen upon the Medieval Highlands, Desert Frontier, and Cursed Vale. The curse turns normal monsters into shadow infused mindless beasts. Will you aid us in the defense of Trove during this dark time? Craft an Order of the Moon Purification Seal to cleanse yourself of darkness and join the fight against the Shadow.

Their numbers are without end!\n\nI can sense the blessings of the Moon Goddess upon you. This is good, because what I ask will require all the help you can get. This Curse must have a source; we must find it! \n\nPerhaps a clue lies within the nearby dungeons. Try clearing some and see what you can find.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2021_06_Name=Clear a Pumpkin Dungeon.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_06_Description=Shadow's Eve 6/11: Oh my, this is awful. These wolves are overrunning everything! And what’s that, Lunar Condensate?! We'll have to get that back to the quartermasters, but first we must investigate the Pumpkin Dungeons that have started appearing. Perhaps they are the source.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2021_07_Name=Return to the High Priest.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_07_Description=Shadow's Eve 7/11: This is worse than I feared. Were-Pumpkins?! This curse can even affect plants.

Return to the High Priest and report what you have found.\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact with an npc.

It begins with a single corrupted soul and spreads like a plague with each bite and scratch. Thanks to the Lunar Seals you are protected, but others.... \n\nThis Lunar Condensate comes from the depths of the Delves. I suspect you will find the source of this curse there. Using this Lunar Condensate you can craft a gateway to where it came from. Be wary, the shadow is strongest where the light of the Sun and Moon cannot reach.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2021_09_Name=Slay Q'berus.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_09_Description=Shadow's Eve 9/11: The Gateway is crafted, it is now up to you to go to this Wolves' Den and eliminate the source.\n\nPlace the gateway and enter the Delve.

$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_11_Description=Shadow's Eve 11/11: The source was a being called Q'berus? Interesting. When we return to our temples I shall delve into our libraries and research this being. That said, with the source defeated the curse will burn itself out, and the werewolves will fade with the hour of shadow.\n\nYou have proven yourself a valued ally of the Order of the Moon. Please take this and use it to craft our banner. Raise it high and help us guide the Moon Goddess back to Trove.

Unfortunately the other Qubesly are just as finicky with their diet as our speical guests are, PLUS they have to make sure all our chores are done.\n\nDo me a favor? I sent you some of the recipes for my favorite dishes, could you cook a few up? Same deal as before, and each one you cook will bring another me (with more chores) to the hub!

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_01_Name=Meet Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_01_Description=Sunfest 1/11 : Attention Trovians. I won't mince words, Trove is about to change forever. If you want to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing in Trove, meet me by the Events Area in the hub where I'll be waiting with pizza. Pizza is first come first served, so I'd hurry!\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_02_Name=Craft the Chuck Pinzo Mining Banner.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_02_Description=Sunfest 2/11 : Hello Trovian I have a ground breaking opportunity for you, and there's not a moment to lose. I've partnered with Houses Carys, Tysorion, and Panatea to bring you the next big thing in Trove, the Trovian Finite Note! What makes it so special? It's finite! That means it'll hold value long after the time of Sunfest has come and gone, that's a Chuck Pinzo guarantee!\n\n The first thing that you'll need to get started is the permission of all the houses. Go to each Quartermaster and purchase one of their unique TFN Mining Cards. Then use my Pinzo Printer to print one of my illustrious Chuck Pinzo Mining Banners.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_03_Name=Find some Pinzoins
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_03_Description=Sunfest 3/11 : Wonderful! It took so long for me to get the houses on board with this, I'm just so giddy!\n\nLet us get down to business. Houses Carys, Panatea, Tysorion, and I have partnered to bring to Trove two brand new currencies. First is the Pinzoin, trademark pending, which can be ''mined'' by mining any ore in Trove while wearing that banner. Get it? Haha, I crack myself up, but seriously, during focus testing there were some that were unhappy with that method, so you can also find them after defeating enemies in Trove or in the Delves. I'll cover the other new currency once you get enough Pinzoins.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_04_Name=Print a Trovian Finite Note
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_04_Description=Sunfest 4/11 : Wow, that was fast! I barely had time to get my presentation ready! Well, we can skip that for now. Over at my Pinzo Printer you might have noticed that there was more than that banner available to you earlier. The important thing now is the Trovian Finite Note, so how about you head over and print one.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_05_Name=Purchase Anything from a Quartermaster
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_05_Description=Sunfest 5/11 : It's so refreshing to watch others work. \n\nAh, so now the big reveal. These notes can only be printed at Pinzo Printers, and this is the ONLY Pinzo Printer, and that's a Pinzo guarantee. Trovian Finite Notes, or TFN as I like to call them for short, are rigidly restricted so that they maintain a healthy value. I won't go into the technical stuff, but trust me, these will be WAY more valuable than that worthless ''new'' flux from last year.\n\nGo use them to buy something from any of the quartermasters of the Dragon Houses.\n\nYou could also buy the all new never seen before Pinzo's Prints: Recipe Unlocker at my quartermaster! Who knows what you'll find!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_06_Name=Find more Pinzoins
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_06_Description=Sunfest 6/11 : And that's how simple the whole process is! So now that you've got the basics how about you go and farm some more Pinzoins while I watch over the Pinzo Printer here in the hub.\n\nAlso, if you didn't notice there's a way for you to donate Pinzoins to the Pinzo Printer and print randomly from its old data logs. Most of it is useless but there are some gems from past events if you're lucky and the data isn't too corrupted. You can even get more coins that way!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_07_Name=Meet Qubesly in the Hub
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_07_Description=Sunfest 7/11 : Trovian. Trovian! TROVIAN! The dragon houses are in an uproar over your new friend. Get to the hub and meet me by Pinzo's setup.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_08_Name=Meet the Carysian Representative
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_08_Description=Sunfest 8/11 : So it turns out that Chuck Pinzo is a pure scam artist! I can't believe I let him rent this space for his stupid Pinzoins. It turns out that he should have been purchasing those Trovian Finite Notes back from the three houses for regular flux, but when he was supposed to buy the first batch, he just disappeared! On top of that, with him gone there's no way to stop his Pinzo Printer from printing more and more of them.\n\nGo talk to the Carysian Representative to see how they want to handle this while I make sure no more funny business goes on.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_09_Name=Defeat Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_09_Description=Sunfest 9/11 : Ahh Trovian, it is about time you got here. This is unacceptable. First Chuck Pinzo runs off on us, and now Qubesly is forcing us to honor these worthless Trovian Finite Notes for the rest of Sunfest. Harumph!\n\nIf we cannot have justice, then we shall have revenge. Chuck Pinzo is not as smart as he thinks he is. One of my house's representatives has informed me he was seen fleeing into a delve gateway. Purchase one of our, trademark pending, Delve Gateways: Chuck Pinzo that I'm selling. Then get in there, find Chuck Pinzo, and deal with him.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_10_Name=Meet a Chuck Pinzo Invader
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_10_Description=Sunfest 10/11 : Well done Trovian. It would seem however that our work is not done. Qubesly has informed us that Chuck Pinzo has been using that Pinzo Printer of his to copy himself, because of course he has. Apparently Chuck Pinzos are raining down all over Trove. Go and deal with them and report back.\n\nAnd feel free to buy more Gateways and smash him up all over again in the delves. The Dragon Houses may never financially recover from this, so they may as well get revenge over and over again!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_11_Name=Meet the Carysian Representative
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_11_Description=Sunfest 11/11 : Wonderful. With that dealt with you should lean back and enjoy Sunfest. Stop by the Carysian Representative near our house in the hub and they will pay you for your good deeds. Also feel free to keep printing Trovian Finite Notes, Qubesly has set them up to send their flux to us instead of that crook Pinzo, so maybe some of this can be salvaged.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_july2022_12_Name=Find Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_july2022_12_Description=Sunfest Bonus Round: Trovian... Trovian! I'm sorry I've been missing lately but things have gotten a little out of hand. Payment to the Houses? Copies of me in Delves and invasions? I have no Trovely idea what you're speaking of. It sounds like another me is making trouble for me, and I don't like it.\n\nI'm going to stay in my hideout till all of this blows over. It's not so bad here if you can ignore the constant flushing and don't mind all the blank stares.\n\nTell you what though, if you can manage to find me I'll print you one of your very own Pinzo Quartermasters!\n\n Press [HK:Loot] to interact.

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_03_Description=Well done Trovian, but your abilities are far above these weaklings.

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_04_Description=Good to see you champion. Q'bthulhu has twisted and merged its shadow giants with the cursed wolves and created monstrosities. They are very powerful and seem near impervious to damage. We must find a way to weaken them!\n\nThe Moon Goddess was sending her power to Trove but Q'bthulu intercepted her gifts and redirected them here. Perhaps if we collect them for ourselves we'll get a hint as to what must be done.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_05_Name=Feed Hungry Wolves
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_05_Description=Well done. With the power of the Sun Goddess those Lunar Drops can be cleansed at the Radiant Dayspring.\n\nThen with the power of the Sun and Moon Goddess perhaps we can save some of the wolves around here. Craft the Feast of the Sun and Moon at the Radiant Dayspring and find hungry wolves. Perhaps we can save even a few from this dark place.\n\nAnd don't question how the Radiant Dayspring can cook food, when the Sun and Moon Goddess work together anything is possible!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_06_Name=Craft a Solar Seal
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_06_Description=Wonderful, the saved wolves still have Lunar Condensate! That's marvelous. Together with the Acolytes I have discovered how to forge a Solar Seal. They are similar to the Lunar Seals from the Order of the Moon, but with the power of the Sun and Moon Goddess they should bring those Alphas down to size. Craft one at the Radiant Dayspring.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_07_Name=Defeat an Alpha
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_07_Description=Now that you have a Solar Seal we must test it. Find one of the Alphas roaming the Everdark. Run up to it and use the Solar Seal so that it can feel the power of the Sun and Moon Goddess. Elysia has promised the Void will shrink in terror become vulnerable to the power of the Light of the Sun and Moon. And when it is weakened, defeat the Alpha and send these rabid beasts back to their master.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_08_Name=Complete Lunar Plunge Dailies
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_august2022_08_Description=They don't seem so tough anymore do they? No matter how many times Q'bthulhu tries they will never defeat Trove. We will continue the fight, here and in the Fae Forest, until the end of Lunar Plunge. You should keep up the fight as well. See the acolytes in either place and fight back against the Void.\n\nAs for me, one of those Alphas took a bite out of me earlier. I think it's time to go settle the score personally. For Elysia!

That banner looks great, so you should put it on, but I won't force ya.\n\nAnyway, the worst part of the Cowboy life is having to deal with all those enemies in Trove messing up your blissful horse rides. How about you go to the Desert Frontier and clean up some of those 'varmints'.

They don't understand how many scoundrels and varmints make your life miserable. They take their green jungles and their shade for granted.

If I had to sum up Shadow's Eve in one word, it'd be pumpkins, and there's a lot of them in the Cursed Vale. There are two different kinds of pumpkin-themed locations that appear during Shadow's Eve in the Cursed Vale. One is a little more dangerous than the other, so let's start with the safer one. Look for Pumpkin Patches, they will be smaller than the dungeons, which are usually just one big overgrown pumpkin.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_03_Name=Clear Pumpkin Dungeons
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_03_Description=Shadow's Eve 3/6: The ugly side of Pumpkin Patches is that they mean Pumpkin Dungeons, which are far less flavorful and far more bitey. Every year they come back, and every year Trove fights them off. How about you join in the fight a little huh? They should show up in just about anywhere on Trove other than the Sundered Uplands. If only we knew what the Irradiant Giants there knew maybe we could take care of this.

The curse can send the victim into flurries of rage they can't escape. The Order of the Moon Priests would probably know what to do, but where are they? Maybe if you complete some of Wolfsly's quests they might know how to draw the Order of the Moon to the Hub.

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_01_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 1/7: Trovian. I have come back to the Events area of the hub with news most dire. Please seek me out at once so we may end this curse.\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_02_qrse_Name=Collect Vials of Q'rsed Essence
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_02_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 2/7: As you may have noticed, or Elsphodel forbid you may be afflicted yourself, but the Q'rse from last year has festered in the Wolves' Den and grown stronger. Trovians hit by the attacks of the Bosses in the Wolves' Den have become afflicted with the Q'rsed Bite! \n\nThe Q'rsed Bite can drive you mad and force you to attack whether you want to or not. Thankfully the Order of the Moon has a plan. It starts with collecting Vials of Q'rsed Essence. You should be able to find those every so often when defeating wolves and werewolves in the Cursed Vale. Get started at once, there's not a moment to spare!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_03_qrse_Name=Collect Lunar Condensate
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_03_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 3/7: Now we need the power of Elsphodel. The fiends in the Cursed Vale are drawn to it like moths to a flame. Defeat enemies and Dungeons in the Cursed Vale to collect Lunar Condensate.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_04_qrse_Name=Collect Q'rsebane
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_04_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 4/7: Wonderful, now for the last ingredient, Q'rsebane. It only grows during Shadow's Eve, and only in the Cursed Vale. In hindsight I probably should have told you to look out for it earlier, but I'm an old priest, can you blame me for forgetting? Q'rsebane is a purple flower that grows most places above ground. Keep an eye out and grab what you can find.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_05_qrse_Name=Craft the Cleansing Moonshard
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_05_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 5/7: That should be enough for the Cleansing Moonshard. Head back to the Events area of the hub and use the Shadowy Station to craft a Cleansing Moonshard so we can lift this evil and protect from it in the future.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_06_qrse_Name=Use the Cleansing Moonshard
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_06_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 6/7: All that's left to do is use the Cleansing Moonshard. It will grant you Elsphodel's Blessing, which will protect you from damage, render you immune to the Q'rsed Bite, and summon Elsphodel's Wrath upon enemies you attack while under its effects. Sadly the protection only lasts for two hours, so you may need to craft more if you want to spend any more time in the Wolves' Den.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_07_qrse_Name=Complete Shadow's Eve Dailies
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2022_07_qrse_Description=Q'rsed Bite 7/7: And with that you are cured, praise Elsphodel. More of my acolytes have made their way to the Events area of the hub. Please speak with them and complete any tasks they may have for you. The Order of the Moon protects Trove, but it can use any and all help it can get.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_01_Name=Use the Friendsgiving Oven
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_01_Description=Friendsgiving 2022 1/6: Hello Trovian! I have returned to the Hub to help cook another wonderful dinner for Friendsgiving. This year we're inviting a lot of friends, and I could use some help. I've heard the phrase 'Too many cooks in the kitchen', but whoever said that never had to cook for dinosaurs. To start things off how about you use the Friendsgiving Oven so we can start cooking!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_02_Name=Cook a Side Dish
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_02_Description=Friendsgiving 2022 2/6: Before the main courses can be prepared we must prepare the sides. Use the Friendsgiving Oven to whip up one of the sides that looks good to you, but if you want to cook other sides I won't stop you!\n\nBy the way, last year I found so many spare recipes lying around that I started putting a cookbook together. If you want to craft those they are located in the decorations section of the Friendsgiving Oven.\n\nAlso if you need some vegetables, talk to Chefsly Jr. by the Vegetable Sink, I think he should have some.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_03_Name=Cook some of Qubesly's Favorites
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_03_Description=Friendsgiving 2022 3/6: Now, before we can cook up the Special Orders to bring our guests to the hub we'll need to whip up some of Qubesly's Favorites. Really I just need Trovian Bouillon, and lots of it, and they seem to corner the market on it every year.\n\nThe best way to get the Trovian Bouillon is to do tasks for the other Qubeslys. Cook some of their favorites and draw them to the Hub. It's possible some of them returned from last year, so that's less cooking for us if so!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_04_Name=Complete Friendsgiving Dailies
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_04_Description=Friendsgiving 2022 4/6: Wonderful! Now that there are some Qubeslys near the Delver's Guild Hall in the Hub, head on over and see what you can do for them so we can get some Trovian Bouillon and get cooking the Special Orders.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_05_Name=Cook Special Orders
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_05_Description=Friendsgiving 2022 5/6: Perfect. Now that you have some Trovian Bouillon come back to my kitchen in the Events Area of the Hub and speak to me. Give me the Bouillon and I'll give you the ingredients you need. Then you can use the Friendsgiving Oven to craft any of the Special Orders to bring your friends to the hub.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_06_Name=Grab a Bite of some Friendsgiving Food
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_06_Description=Friendsgiving 2022 6/6: There's nothing better than cooking dinner for friends. Grab a chair, if there's still an open one, and grab a bite of something you want. You've earned it!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_00_Name=Prepare some Pinzham
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_00_Description=Pinzo's Penance 0/6: You must craft the complete steps of the Friendsgiving Questline to unlock the recipe for the Special Order: Pinzham and then craft the Special Order: Pinzham to begin the Pinzo's Penance questline.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_01_Name=Meet with Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_01_Description=Pinzo's Penance 1/6: Hello Trovian! There's been a terrible mix up with one of me and a lot of Trove, but I'm here to set the record straight. You'll find me in the Events area of the Hub. Unfortunately I find myself without a seat at the table and next to some scaly and hungry dinosaurs.\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_02_Name=Defeat Invaders for Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_02_Description=Pinzo's Penance 2/6: While some versions of me are stunning combatants, I'm not as talented at battle. I'd like to do some good in Trove, but unfortunately most of the tasks required to help involve battle. Fortunately for me, what I lack in ability I can make up for in wealth! Please go fight the Shadow Gobbler invaders and help me repair my reputation.\n\nInvaders can be found periodically in any Adventure world in Trove.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_03_Name=Complete Friendsgiving Dailies
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_03_Description=Pinzo's Penance 3/6: Wonderful job Trovian. With the invaders pushed back we must turn our attention to the Qubeslys of Trove. They don't like me, though I can't figure out why. Maybe if you help them out in my name, and maybe speak well of me while doing so, they might change their minds?\n\nThe Qubeslys are hanging out by the Delver's Guild Hall, head over there and complete some of their Dailies and maybe they'll appreciate the effort.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_04_Name=Complete a Delve for Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_04_Description=Pinzo's Penance 4/6: These Shadow Gobblers are so relentless, they'd be wonderful business partners if they weren't so mean. Try hopping into a delve and defeating a Turkeytopia delve for me. \n\nYou can get into the delve by crafting a Delve Gateway: Turkeytopia or a Delve Gateway: Trotting Turkey at the Turkeytopia Table. You can find them at the Crafter's Corner or in Chefsly's kitchen.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_05_Name=Throw Confetti for Chuck Pinzo
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_05_Description=Pinzo's Penance 5/6: Trovian, you really are something. I'm still getting angry looks and side glances, but at least the muttering has stopped! I think if you spruce up the Hub a bit, maybe with some confetti, they'll at least finally let me out of this pen and give me a seat at the table!
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_06_Name=Grab a Bite of Pinzham, at your own peril.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_november2022_pinzo_06_Description=Pinzo's Penance 6/6: Perfect! I'm finally sitting, or standing really, just where I should be, and it's all thanks to you Trovian! I'll make sure to let you know about my next big sch- er..., PLAN before anyone else. That's a Chuck Pinzo guarantee!\n\nMeanwhile try some of the Pinzham you cooked, or really opened, it's truly 'adequately nutritional' and 'technically food' to quote just a few of our focus testers.\n\nPinzham can be obtained by cooking it at the Friendsgiving Oven or grabbed at the Pinzham plate on the Friendsgiving Table in the Hub.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_01_Name=Meet up with Elfsly
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_01_Description=Snowfest 2022 1/7: Trovian! Winter's here, kind of. I'm not sure what's going on to be honest, but this year feels a lot more summery than wintery. It's still Snowfest though,  and Snowfest is still the perfect way to end the year. Stop by the Events area of the Hub and get into the giving spirit.\n\n Press [HK:Loot] to interact with an NPC.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_02_Name=Craft a Gift Giver's Standard
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_02_Description=Snowfest 2022 2/7:  Hello Trovian, happy Snowfest! I've got the Snowfest Table setup for you to craft a Gift Giver's Standard again this year, so craft one and lets get to the gifts.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_03_Name=Unwrap a Gift
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_03_Description=Snowfest 2022 3/7: Each year the enemies of Trove go around stealing gifts from others. The Gift Giver's Standard allows you to take them back. Run around defeating enemies in Trove and see if you can claim any of the gifts back.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_04_Name=Clear Present Dungeons
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_04_Description=Snowfest 2022 4/7: I hope you got what you wanted and if you didn't, there's always more tomorrow!\n\nOf course, as always, the Present dungeons have returned to Trove. Don't be fooled when you defeat their leader, they like to keep their 'treasure' in mimics. Be on guard and clear a few out.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_05_Name=Clear Tree Dungeons
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_05_Description=Snowfest 2022 5/7: We can't forget to deal with the Tree dungeons as well. They are much bigger and a much bigger threat. They can pop up anywhere in Trove, so find a few and give 'em what for.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_06_Name=Complete a Snowfest Daily
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_06_Description=Snowfest 2022 6/7: Trovian you rock. It worked! Chillio and all of the others have finally made it to the Hub! We're all hanging out in the Event's area talking about all the good we can do all over trove. Meet with us and help us spread the Snowfest cheer.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_07_Name=Donate at the Donation Station
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_07_Description=Snowfest 2022 7/7:  Thank you Trovian. The best part of Snowfest is giving back. The donation station is back and ready to send whatever you donate to those in need. Use the Donation Station sitting next to the Snowfest Table in the Events area of the Hub to donate to the needy in Trove.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_08_Name=Open Your Gift
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_08_Description=Snowfest 2022 Bonus:  Trovian, me and the gang got you something. It's in the Trove hub, you can't miss it. And hurry up 'cause come the new year I'm pretty sure that Elfsly is cleaning up the hub.\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact with your gift.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_00_Name=Surfin' Snowfest
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_00_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 0/6: Complete all 7 of the Snowfest 2022 adventures to unlock Surfin' Snowfest.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_01_Name=Craft Saged Snowballs
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_01_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 1/6: Trovian, it's good to see ya again. You may have noticed the Hub is a bit different this year. That's because it can't always be snowing during Snowfest everywhere in Trove. This year the Hub happens to be where it's warmer, but don't worry about me, it's always cool wherever I am.\n\nThat said you should try and spread some cheer in the warmer parts of Trove this year, and there's no better way than snowballs. You'll need to bring your own though as there wont be any snow where you're going. Come to the Snowfest Table in the Events area of the Hub and craft some Saged Snowballs.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_02_Name=Use Saged Snowballs in the Treasure Isles.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_02_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 2/6: Saged Snowballs are great, they're enchanted against melting and are so powerful they can turn lava to ice. Now that you're prepared, head to the Treasure Isles. Once you're there throw some Saged Snowballs to show 'em how fun Snowfest can be!
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_03_Name=Hop on your Boat.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_03_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 3/6: The treasure isles are great, if not a bit warm. There's water as far as the eye can see and treasure for those willing to look hard enough. How about you hop on your boat and sail the seas.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_04_Name=Catch Some Fish.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_04_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 4/6: Boating is great, but you can't really do it in the Permafrost since all the water is frozen. Another thing you can't do very well there is fish! The Treasure Isles have plenty of them though, so how about you try and catch a few. Thankfully it's easy to do from a boat as long as you're not moving.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_05_Name=Save some Horned Rumpfus.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_05_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 5/6: Trovian I'm getting some unfortunate reports that Horned Rumpfus have been spotted in the Treasure Isles. That's not good, Horned Rumpfus are what happens when a yeti gets too warm and the ice on their fur melts. When the ice melts they get hot, which makes them angry, which makes them dangerous. Thankfully Saged Snowballs can cover them in ice AND teleport them back to the Permafrost. \n\nIt's a good thing we prepared for this obvious course of events. It's not luck as long as you knew it was coming, and you and I obviously knew this was coming. Yep nothing surprises us. So you obviously know the next step is finding the Horned Rumpfus and throwing Saged Snowballs at them, becuase that was the plan we had all along.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_06_Name=Use Warm Fuzzy Feeling.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_dec2022_story_06_Description=Surfin' Snowfest 6/6: Phew! At least the Saged Snowballs makes it easy to deal with Horned Rumpfus, because they can be annoying otherwise. Well good job Trovian, you brought Snowfest to the Treasure Isles and helped send some Yetis back to the Permafrost. You even got some Warm Fuzzy Feelings to boot! Use one and feel good about yourself, you earned it!
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_01_Name=Visit the Radiant Dayspring
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_01_Description=Renewus 2023 1/7: Hi Trovian! Renewus is back and it's time to party! Head to the Radiant Dayspring in the Events are of the Hub!\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_02_Name=Throw Confetti
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_02_Description=Renewus 2023 2/7: Awesome! As you can see there's plenty of awesome stuff to craft here, but let's start by celebrating with some confetti. Craft some and throw it around like you just don't care!
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_03_Name=Jump Around
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_03_Description=Renewus 2023 3/7: Are you hyped yet? Because I am! Show your hype and jump around!
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_04_Name=Defeat Pirrots in the Neon City and Luminopolis
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_04_Description=Renewus 2023 4/7: Trovian, pleas for help are coming in from the Neon City and Luminopolis. The Pirrots of the Treasure Isles have long held a grudge against the Neon City and they've chosen Renewus as the perfect time to strike.\n\nWith so many celebrating there's no one to defend the Neon Cities from the Pirrot's plundering. Go and help and fight back these invaders, you're their only hope!
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_05_Name=Craft at the Radiant Dayspring
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_05_Description=Renewus 2023 5/7: Trovian, you may have already noticed but these Pirrots are dropping their precious doubloons. If you head back to the Radiant Dayspring in the Hub you should be able to craft a new ship, the Neon Pearl, or convert them to Lucky Doubloons. Lucky Doubloons will help you fend off the Pirrots and the Neon Pearl will help you with what comes next.\n\nIn the end craft anything in the General category that you think will help.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_06_Name=Defeat Dungeons in the Treasure Isles
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_06_Description=Renewus 2023 6/7: Well Captain, it's finally time to take it to the scourge of the seas. Go to the Treasure Isles and show the Pirrots there that no attack on Trove will go unaswered.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_07_Name=Hit the Renewus Orb
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_jan2023_07_Description=Renewus 2023 7/7: Well done Trovian. The Pirrot raids continue, so feel free to put your captain hat on and beat 'em up as much as you want, but don't sacrifice celebrating Renewus. Make sure to get to the Hub and hit the Renewus ball a few times to celebrate the new year!
