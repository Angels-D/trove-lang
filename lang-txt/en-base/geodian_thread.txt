$geodianthread_00_name=Talk to Amberine to Start the Geode Caves Expertise Quest
$geodianthread_00_description=Side Quest: Geode Cave Expertise - Talk to Amberine in the Trove Hub to start your adventure into the depths of the Geode caves and unlock better equipment for your discovery suit. You can find Amberine at the entrance to the Geodian Guild Hall.
$geodianthread_01_name=Go to Moonglow Grotto
$geodianthread_01_description=It's time to explore the depths of Geode, Trovian! I'm Amberine.\n\nThe caves are too dangerous for most Geodians, but the Sunseekers have opened portals just for Trovians like you.\n\nYou can use either the portal down below in the Geodian Guild Hall or the Atlas to get to Geode. Once you land in Geode take an airavator down to the Mining Facility and use the purple portal to Moonglow Grotto.
$geodianthread_02_name=Use Your Climbing Claw
$geodianthread_02_description=The main parts of your discovery suit are the GAS, or Geodian Acclimation System, and N-Charge. The GAS allows you to withstand the caves' atmosphere longer, while the N-Charge powers the rest of your modules.\n\nMy favorite module is the Climbing Claw! It can grapple onto higher ledges or knock back critters - without injury, of course. We Geodians would never harm a thing!\n\nUse your Climbing Claw and latch onto a wall or ledge.
$geodianthread_03_name=Use Your Omni-Tool
$geodianthread_03_description=For all your gathering needs, you've got the Omni-Tool.\n\nIt's short-range for now, but you can upgrade that later at the Module Forge.\n\nUse your Omni-Tool.
$geodianthread_04_name=Help 3 Cave Critters
$geodianthread_04_description=YOU THERE! If you MUST invade the home of the creatures who live in these caves, I insist you help them.\n\nI had Amberine give you Critter Treats, Curing Kits, and Comfort Blankets to tend to the cave critters you find. They should already be equipped to your hotkey bar. If you run out, make more at our sanctuary's Crystallogy Center using materials from the caves.\n\nHelp 3 cave critters. Use Critter Treats on hungry critters, Curing Kits on injured critters, and Comfort Blankets on cold critters.
$geodianthread_05_name=Gather in Moonglow Grotto
$geodianthread_05_description=Oof. Did Sunseeker Gabbro yell at you? Our Companion Master's frazzled after caring for all the creatures being hurt by Shadows... He doesn't mean anything by it.\n\nWhy don't you go gather some materials for us? That would get you in Gabbro's good graces for sure.\n\nUse your Omni-Tool to gather 40 gleamstone, moonstone, day drops, or dream dew in Moonglow Grotto.
$geodianthread_06_name=Run out of GAS
$geodianthread_06_description=Travel through the caves as far as you can!\n\nOnce your GAS (the red meter on your toolbar) runs out, one of our trained adventurers will come fetch you.\n\nExplore the area until you run out of GAS. You can also return to the Geode Sanctuary at any time by pressing [HK:Homeworld].
$geodianthread_07_name=Craft Critter Treats
$geodianthread_07_description=YOU are the Trovian come to save us? Hm.\n\nI am Sunseeker Lazul. First, you will save more cave creatures - and save Gabbro some heartache.

$geodianthread_08_name=Redeem Reliquary Token
$geodianthread_08_description=Nice! Lazul gave you a Reliquary Token. Redeem it at the Reliquary Research Lab - and don't be alarmed by Sunseeker Th'lan, if you see her. She's on our side. \n\nTake an airavator up one floor and head west to redeem your token with Reliquary Merchant Thundros.
$geodianthread_09_name=Go to Sunken Sunvault (or another Geode cave)
$geodianthread_09_description=You are strong... Th'lan sees.\n\nCarry the Reliquary! Remnants of Ancients lie inside. Down, deep, magic sleeps. Sunken Sunvault calls... Return the reliquary... return the Ancient to its home...\n\nTake an airavator down to the Mining Facility and return to the Geode caves. Th'lan suggests you use the orange portal to go to Sunken Sunvault this time.
$geodianthread_10_name=Charge Your Reliquary
$geodianthread_10_description=Ancient power locked inside... Th'lan knows. Reliquary hungry for magic. Magic flows through caves... Feed reliquary. Let Th'lan break it open!\n\nEquip the Token Reliquary in your discovery suit loadout. Heal, feed, or comfort critters in the caves to charge your reliquary.
$geodianthread_11_name=Open Your Reliquary

Th'lan will crack it open!\n\nReturn to the sanctuary by running out of GAS or pressing [HK:Homeworld]. Take an airavator up one floor and place your reliquary into the revealer located on the west side of Sunseeker Square.
$geodianthread_12_name=Gather in Sunken Sunvault
$geodianthread_12_description=You're allowed to touch the reliquaries!? Sunseeker Th'lan must like you. Hehe.\n\nWould ya mind going back to Sunken Sunvault and gathering more materials? And don't forget to craft more critter treats before you go! It'd make Gabbro happy.\n\nGather 75 sun sap, day drops, gleamstone, or blazine from Sunken Sunvault. In exchange, I'll give you an Accelerite, which decreases the time it takes for reliquaries and companion eggs to open.
$geodianthread_13_name=Go to Verdant Veins
$geodianthread_13_description=Sunseeker Th'lan needs resources from Verdant Veins!\n\nNext time you're in the sanctuary, use the green portal on the bottom floor to go to Verdant Veins.\n\nAlso, Lazul noticed that you uh, might need help reaching high places, so she made you Prospecting Platforms. Use them to reach higher-up materials in the caves! If you run out, make more with Crystallogy.
$geodianthread_14_name=Gather in Verdant Veins
$geodianthread_14_description=Twin stone... geminite... and greens from the deep... Wavy kelp... back and forth... Th'lan needs!\n\nGather these for Th'lan... and receive... the Ancients' gift...\n\nGather 75 cave kelp, geminite, gleamstone, or day drops from Verdant Veins.

$geodianthread_16_description=If you want to travel deeper into the caves, you've got to upgrade your GAS!\n\nSo far you've mostly explored Tier 1 of the caves.

$geodianthread_17_name=Use a Thumper
$geodianthread_17_description=You earned a Thumper Core! Now you can make a Thumper at the Module Workbench, next to the Module Forge.\n\nThe Thumper reveals hidden crystals and shows you the full depth of ore veins!\n\nCraft a Thumper and use it in the caves. As a reward, I picked up some reliquaries from Th'lan! Funny, she only let me have 'em once she found out they were for you. Hehe.
$geodianthread_18_name=Gather Plants in Moonglow Grotto
$geodianthread_18_description=Our Companion Master - do you remember him? Sunseeker Gabbro? He's been really worried about the cave critters lately. The Shadows outside have them all scared...\n\nHe needs some plants to help the creatures under his care. Would you go get some for him?\n\nGather 35 pieces of dream dew, day drops, acrobat bark, and moonlit moss from Moonglow Grotto. Dream dew and day drops grow in Tier 1 and Tier 2. Acrobat bark and moonlit moss only grow in Tier 2.
$geodianthread_19_name=Help 25 Cave Critters
$geodianthread_19_description=Be the light! I apologize for my rudeness the last time we spoke. Shadows have hurt quite a lot of Geodian creatures... and it, well, it's been difficult.\n\nI am Sunseeker Gabbro. I wrote the book on Geodian creatures - several books, in fact! They're such fascinating creatures.\n\nCould you go and soothe 25 creatures in the caves with Critter Treats, Comfort Blankets, and Curing Kits? I, and they, would be grateful.
$geodianthread_20_name=Mine Geminite

$geodianthread_21_name=Craft Rocket Boots

$geodianthread_22_description=The materials you've collected have helped us out so much.

$geodianthread_23_name=Gather Uncommon Plants
$geodianthread_23_description=Hello again, young Trovian.

In the meantime, would you go and gather more plants for us?\n\nGather 20 moonlit moss, cogwine, acrobat bark, or cavebirds. These plants can only be found in Tier 2 of the caves.
$geodianthread_24_name=Mine Blazine
$geodianthread_24_description=Exciting news! I'm ready to put the finishing touch on my latest invention: the Barrier Generator. I just need a few more materials from Sunken Sunvault.\n\nWould you go to to Sunken Sunvault and mine 75 blazine for me?

$geodianthread_36_description=Your howlug looks happy to be with you! Hehe. I can understand why.\n\nFeel free to explore as you like.\n\nOnce you get enough resources for your next GAS upgrade, you'll be able to go into Tier 3! That's further than I've ever gone. I'm impressed!\n\nOne more thing, while I've still got you: Thank you for coming to Geode. I was skeptical when Rowan told us that you might be able to save us. But after meeting you...
